## Demo

* [demosh](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/demosh): demosh can run shell scripts or Markdown files in a very interactive way, showing commentary in between running commands, and waiting for you to hit RETURN to proceed before running commands. It was created as a tool for doing live demos of relatively complex things.
* [Microcks](https://github.com/microcks): API Mocking and Testing. Useful to quickly create mock services based on OpenAPI specification for demo applications.
